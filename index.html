        <p>MANILA, Philippines — Athletes who brought home medals in the 
           Hangzhou Asian Games are set to receive around P41.9 million worth
           of incentives from the government, according to Malacañang on Wednesday. </p>

        <p>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself is set to honor the Filipino athletes
           at Rizal Memorial Coliseum in Manila.</p>
        
        <p>“Each of the medalists will receive incentives from the Philippine Sports Commission 
            through the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, totaling P19.1 million. Additional 
            incentives from the Office of the President, amounting to a collective P22.8 million, will 
            also be granted,” said the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) in a statement.</p>

        <p>Asian Games medalists include EJ Obiena, who delivered the Philippines' first gold in the 
           competition in the men's pole vault.</p>
            
        <p>The Gilas Pilipinas men's basketball team also scored a historic win, ending the Philippines' 
           61-year gold drought in the Asian Games.</p>

        <p>“All 33 Filipino medalists will receive a Presidential Citation in recognition of their demonstrated 
            excellence and achievements in their respective sports during the recently concluded 2023 Asian Games 
            in Hangzhou, China, thereby increasing national interest and awareness of sports among the youth and 
            other aspiring Filipino athletes,” the PCO said.
